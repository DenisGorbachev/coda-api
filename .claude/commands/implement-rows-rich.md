* Notice that the autogenerated code in src/lib.rs does not fully match the OpenAPI spec in coda.openapi.json
  * The output of `list_rows` in case of `value_format == ValueFormat::Rich` is not correct
* Note that `Client::list_rows` is mostly correct - only using `types::RowList` is wrong. `types::RowList` works correctly only if `value_format == ValueFormat::Simple`, but not if `value_format == ValueFormat::Rich`
* Implement `fn list_rows_rich` in src/ext.rs
  * The function body should be similar to `Client::list_rows`
  * The arguments must not contain `value_format`
  * The function body must set `value_format` to `ValueFormat::Rich` in the parameters for the request
  * The function return type must correctly reflect the rich value format (perhaps you need to write your own types, try to reuse some types in src/lib.rs)
* Implement examples/list_rows_rich.rs similar to examples/metadata.rs
* Test by running the list_rows_rich example
  * The environment variables for api_key and doc_id are already set
